1) the references for the other classes must be interfaces , AND NOT OBJECTS
2) two strategies for dependency injection: by constructor vs. by setter ( advantage for the setter - allows us to change the refrence at any moment in time
3) if the reference has a major importance withing the defined class, inject when building the object
4) extending RuntimeException - eliminate the need to use throws at signitures within our code
